            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>
                In early 2015, my employer, i360, needed a mobile front end to its Predictive Dialer application. i360 is a political data company. Many of its products are aimed at helping professionals at advocacy groups and political campaigns, its main customers, to gather and analyze data about voters.  
              </p><p>
                One of our solutions, the Predictive Dialer, was a data-gathering application that helped customers to administer phone surveys to targeted lists of voters. The Predictive Dialer, in its normal configuration, places calls through the server. When calls are connected, the server routes each call to a user, usually a campaign volunteer, using a client app called i360 Calls. 
              </p><p>
                In addition to connecting the user to phone calls routed from the server, the client app allows the user to submit survey answers or other information such as wrong numbers or refusals to participate. The resulting data is then integrated into the client’s main i360-managed database of voters.
            </p>

              <a href="/images/port-page-img/ios-calls-iphone-zoom.png" data-lightbox="ios-calls-ios" data-title="i360 Calls for iPhone mockups"  alt="i360 Calls for iPhone">
                <img src="images/port-page-img/ios-calls-iphone.png" srcset="images/port-page-img/ios-calls-iphone@2x.png 814w, images/port-page-img/ios-calls-iphone.png 407w" width="407" >
              </a>
            </div>
            <p>
                i360 Calls was an aging web application whose usability was poor and could only be used on desktop browsers. i360’s management wanted a solution that was easier to use, and that would let users use their own mobile devices to call. Customers also wanted deploy our apps onto inexpensive devices such as iPad Minis in order to run onsite “phone” banks.
               </p>

            <p>
                The management decided that, in addition to developing an improved web app (<a href="i360-calls-web.html">whose development I describe here</a>), we should develop native Android and iOS versions of this software. Initially, they wanted to adopt the design of our similar apps for supporting door-to-door canvassers, but I felt that these apps reflected the rushed circumstances of their development and were not as well designed as they should have been. I convinced them that we should give these apps a fresh design from the ground up.

            <h4>The Users</h4>
            <p>
              The users of our app were mainly campaign and non-profit volunteers who could not be assumed to have any special expertise besides basic web-browsing skills. Unfortunately, I didn’t have access to testers or users in our target demographic. On the other hand, our own staff, including non-technical users, used and tested this app and provided feedback.   

               </p>
            <h4>Challenges and Special Considerations</h4>
            <p>
              Due to a patchwork of state regulations regarding the use of automated dialers, the app could not function identically for all users. For instance, some jurisdictions bar automated dialers and all calls must be placed manually.  Therefore, the app had to operate slightly differently for different use cases, and we had to think through some special circumstances. 
            </p>

                <img src="images/port-page-img/ios-calls-android.png" srcset="images/port-page-img/ios-calls-android@2x.png 846w, images/port-page-img/ios-calls-android.png 423w"  width="423" alt="i360 Calls for Android">
              </a>
            </div>
            <p>
              Additionally, once connected to the server, the app’s UI consisted not only of the display but also spoken instructions and audio cues. I had no control over that part of the application. I designed the apps to complement and reinforce the server-based audio portion of the application.
              </p>
            <p>
              I had to work quickly to create wireframes and deliver high-fidelity mockups to our developers with detailed guidance as to the apps’ functionality. The management was highly motivated to get the apps developed very quickly. Therefore, it was infeasible to employ a formal UX methodology or structured user testing beyond getting feedback from co-workers testing the app.

            <h4>Design &amp; Development</h4>
            <p>
              I was responsible for all phases of design for this app, from wireframes to design comps for iOS and Android through testing for design issues, as well as writing copy for prompts, labels, and error messages.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the main considerations when designing this app was that it would often be used only once or a few times &mdash; for example, a user might be volunteering to man a phone bank for one or two nights. Therefore, I made the design very straightforward, giving each button clear affordances and eschewing ambiguous design conventions like text-only buttons. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As these apps were being designed, Apple had for some time been encouraging developers to use Auto Layout and, with the introduction of the iPhone 6 and 6+, it was clear that we would need to be ready for an expanding number of arbitrary screen sizes, possibly including currently-unknown future sizes. For this reason I directed the design staff to use Auto Layout rather coding for fixed screen sizes as we had done in our previous apps.
            </p>
            <div class="port-img">
              <a href="/images/port-page-img/ios-calls-testing-zoom.jpg" data-lightbox="ios-calls-ios" data-title="Testing the app" >
                <img src="images/port-page-img/ios-calls-testdevices.jpg" srcset="images/port-page-img/ios-calls-testdevices@2x.jpg 1042w, images/port-page-img/ios-calls-testdevices.jpg 521w" width="521" alt="Testing the App" >
              </a>
            </div>
            <p>
              I tried to be faithful to each platform in terms aesthetics and in the use of platform UI conventions, like Android’s Action Bar, while keeping the app’s design consistent across platforms. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Although Material Design was Google’s recommended design language at the time of these apps’ development, for various reasons, I designed it instead to conform to the Holo Light UI theme, which was Google’s previous recommended style. Basically, I felt that I didn’t have the time to become familiar enough with the Material Design guidelines and I didn’t want to risk a poor, rushed implementation.   
            </p>
            <p>
              I provided all necessary graphic assets to the development team and gave detailed guidance to our developers throughout the process. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Our iOS and Android developers were highly competent programmers but needed plenty guidance to accurately translate the design mocks to the finished app. I would provide feedback in the form of detailed visual guides as the development work progressed. These also helped our QA team to validate the visual-design aspects of the app.
              </p>
            <p>
              I used a number of my own devices, including several running iOS and one Android tablet, to help test a variety of screen sizes and models.
              </p>
            <p>
              At the time I left the company, the app was in its final testing and bug-fixing phase. It has by now entered production and has been used by thousands of users.
              </p>
            <h4>Results &amp; Conclusion</h4>
            <p>
              I left the company just as the apps were finishing the QA process, so I unfortunately wasn’t there for the initial reaction and feedback on the finished apps. I hear from my former colleagues that the apps have been well received by i360’s customers.  
               </p>
               <p>
              I do think the project could have benefited from a more deliberate design process, including competitive analysis, qualitative research involving stakeholders, and user testing at all stages of design and development.   
            </p>
            <p>
              Nevertheless, I enjoyed working on this project. It felt good to take the app&rsquo;s design all the way to production, guiding the developers in the implementation of the design, and to be involved in all of the details of the interface.
