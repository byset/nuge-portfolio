     <h1>Three Officials at Center of Graft Scandal Were Secretaries to Ex-High Official</h1>
     <div class="summary">Ji Wenlin, Yu Gang and Tan Hong all had ties to a former member of the Communist Party's top decision-making body</div><br/>
     <div class="author">By staff reporters Yu Ning, He Xin and Lin Yunshi and Hong Kong correspondent Wang Duan</div><br/><br/>
     <div id="tst_content">
      <P>(Beijing) — In the latest development in China's anti-corruption campaign, three high-level officials were expelled from the Communist Party on July 2, according to the Central Discipline Inspection Commission (CDIC), the party's top anti-graft watchdog.</P>
<P>All were charged with abuse of power and taking bribes, and the three also shared similarities in their journey climbing the rungs of officialdom's ladder in that they were secretaries to senior officials.</P>
<P>The three are Ji Wenlin, former deputy governor of Hainan Province; Yu Gang, former deputy director of the office of the party's Central Politics and Law Committee; and Tan Hong, a former senior staff officer of the Ministry of Public Security.</P>
<P>The three were also linked to other sacked officials in their previous jobs: Guo Yongxiang, former deputy governor of Sichuan Province; Li Hualin, former vice general manager of China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC); and Shen Dingcheng, former party chief of PetroChina International Co.</P>
<P>Guo was sacked in June 2013, while Li and Shen were detained in August 2013 and in January, respectively.</P>
<P><STRONG>Network of Secretaries</STRONG></P>
<P>In 1988, 25-year-old Li Hualin was appointed to the general office of the newly established state oil major CNPC and worked as a secretary of the then deputy general manager of the company, Zhou Yongkang, who later joined the Politburo Standing Committee, the party's top decision-making body.</P>
<P>Zhou retired from the Politburo Standing Committee in late 2012. From 2007 to 2012, he headed the party's Central Politics and Law Committee, which meant he handled the nation's public security affairs.</P>
<P>In March 1992, Li was promoted to CNPC's Houston office in the United States as deputy head. Replacing him as the secretary was Shen Dingcheng, a classmate of Li's at the Southwest Petroleum Institute in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, which was later renamed Southwest Petroleum University.</P>
<P>Zhou left CNPC in 1998 after 31 years in the oil industry to head the new Ministry of Land and Resources (MLR). Shen remained at CNPC and was promoted to vice general manager of China National United Oil Corp., CNPC's oil trading subsidiary. Guo Yongxiang, Zhou's senior secretary at that time, followed Zhou to the MLR as general office director in July 1998.</P>
<P>In China, provincial and upper-level officials usually have two secretaries to support them in their work. A senior secretary helps the official with daily affairs while a secondary secretary helps arrange an agenda and prepare documents.</P>
<P>Replacing Shen as Zhou's secondary secretary was Ji Wenlin, who previously worked as deputy director of the general office of the then Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, which merged into the MLR. </P>
<P>Ji worked with Zhou for nearly a decade, following him to the Sichuan government in 2000 and the Ministry of Public Security in 2003. In 2008, Ji returned the MLR to become director of its general office – one year after Zhou was promoted to the Politburo Standing Committee.</P>
<P>Less information is available for Yu Gang and Tan Hong. Yu, a Jiangxi native, joined the general office of State Council, China's cabinet, as a secretary after graduation, and became Zhou's secondary secretary in 2003. Tan previously worked as Zhou's security secretary.</P>
<P><STRONG>Ties to CNPC</STRONG></P>
<P>Both Li Hualin and Shen Dingcheng spent most of their careers at CNPC. </P>
<P>"Probably because he started as a secretary, Li is more like an official rather than a company manager," a Hong Kong investor who knew Li said. "He is not an open-minded person."</P>
<P>But Li had a successful career at CNPC. After years in the company's Houston and Canada operations, he was appointed general manager of PetroChina International's Canadian branch in 1995. Four years later, he was named general manager of PetroChina International's branch in Kazakhstan. </P>
<P>Li returned to China in 2001 and became deputy general manager of PetroChina Hong Kong Co. In 2007, he was appointed vice president of PetroChina and chairman of subsidiary Kunlun Energy Co.</P>
<P>On July 29, 2013, CNPC published a statement naming Li vice general manager of the group. This was less than one month before he was placed under investigation by the CDIC.</P>
<P>Shen's fall came in January after nearly 17 years working at PetroChina International, the overseas oil and gas trading subsidiary of CNPC. Shen was the vice president and party chief of the company.</P>
<P><STRONG>The Fall of Guo Yongxiang</STRONG></P>
<P>Among the six, Guo Yongxiang and Ji Wenlin climbed highest. Sources said Guo has a strong relationship with the Sichuan government and the oil industry.</P>
<P>Born in 1949, Guo is a native of the eastern province of Shandong. He spent 26 years starting in 1972 at China's second-largest oil field, Shengli Oil Field, and in CNPC.</P>
<P>In July 1998, he was transferred to the general office of the new MLR as Zhou's senior secretary. Two years later, he moved to Sichuan to continue the secretary's job with Zhou, then party chief of the southwestern province.</P>
<P>Guo saw his career develop in Sichuan and he was appointed vice governor in January 2006. He oversaw agriculture, forestry and water projects.</P>
<P>Officials in Sichuan describe Guo as well-versed in how to succeed as an official in China.</P>
<P>"He was very experienced in officialdom," one official said. "He always had a smile on his face and was willing to do small favors."</P>
<P>Another source in the Sichuan government said Guo was trusted by higher leaders, and lower officials saw him as a bridge to those higher officials.</P>
<P>During his tenure, hydropower projects backed by Liu Han, chairman of Sichuan Hanlong Group; Wu Bing, chairman of Zhongxu (Hong Kong) Ltd.; and Zhou Bin, former chairman of Beijing Zhongxu Yangguang Petroleum and Natural Gas Technology Ltd., were approved. Both Wu and Zhou are embroiled in corruption inquiries, while Liu was formally arrested in July 2013 and stood on trial in late March for a host of gang-related crimes, including murder.</P>
<P>With his ties to CNPC, Guo also helped Sichuan-based private company Star Cable Co. Ltd. become a major supplier to CNPC and other state-owned hydropower and energy companies starting in 2004, local media reports say. According to Star Cable's documents, revenue from CNPC accounted for more than 30 percent of its revenue in the first half 2013. Last July, Li Guangyuan, chairman of Star Cable, was put under investigation.</P>
<P>Guo retired as vice governor in 2008, was elected vice chairman of the Sichuan People's Congress and appointed president of Sichuan Federation of Literary and Art Circles.</P>
<P>In June 2013, the CDIC announced it was probing Guo. In early April, the CDIC said on its website that Guo used his position to seek personal benefits and took massive bribes himself or through his son. Guo is also accused of amoral behavior, likely a reference to the keeping of mistresses. The anti-graft fighter said Guo was expelled from the party and facing criminal charges.</P>
<P><STRONG>Rise and Fall in Hainan</STRONG></P>
<P>After years as Zhou's secretary in the MLR, the Sichuan government and the security ministry, Ji saw his career take off in southern island province of Hainan. In 2010, the then 44-year-old Ji, who was working as director of the MLR's General Office, was appointed vice mayor and vice party secretary of Haikou, the capital city of Hainan, as part of the government's training program for young leaders. In January 2013, Ji was promoted to vice governor of Hainan.</P>
<P>Sources close to the Hainan government said Ji developed strong connections with officials during his days as secretary. In early 2011, he led several Haikou officials to Beijing to seek financial support for a development project in the city. Later that year, the MLR and the Ministry of Finance earmarked 3.2 billion yuan for the project, the fastest approval ever granted to the province.</P>
<P>Ji also led Haikou to apply for hosting the 2017 World Petroleum Congress. The application, filed with the State Council in January 2011, won approval by the cabinet in March 2012, despite this, the city lost the competition to Istanbul, Turkey. </P>
<P>A Haikou official said Ji "led a team to Beijing and met with officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, CNPC and the National Energy Administration and finally won approval by the State Council." Ji also met Jiang Jiemin, then chairman of CNPC, who promised to offer financial support to the city, said the Haikou official.</P>
<P>Jiang, who later became the head of China's state-owned asset regulator, was placed under a corruption investigation in September 2013. He was expelled from the party and his case was passed to prosecutors in July. </P>
<P>In January 2013, Ji was promoted to vice governor of Hainan, overseeing land and resources, urban planning and construction and state-owned assets.</P>
<P>Between late December and mid-January, Ji disappeared from the public eye for around 20 days, triggering speculation that he was being probed. A source close to the situation told Caixn that Ji was asked to go to Beijing for inquiries several times during that period. </P>
<P>But Ji resumed public activity in late January and attended the provincial people's congress in early February.</P>
<P>However, on February 18, the CDIC published a statement on its website that said Ji was under investigation for "serious discipline violations," making him the 19th vice minister-level official to be sacked since the 18th party congress in November 2012. Ji is also the last of six secretaries related to Zhou to be detained. </P>
<P>On July 2, the CDIC announced that Ji had been expelled from the party for abusing his power, taking a huge amount of bribes and adultery. Ji faces criminal charges.　　</P>
<P>The same day, the commission said in separate statements that Yu Gang was expelled for similar charges. Tan Hong was also expelled for power abuse and taking bribes.</P>

<P>The three were also linked to other sacked officials in their previous jobs: Guo Yongxiang, former deputy governor of Sichuan Province; Li Hualin, former vice general manager of China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC); and Shen Dingcheng, former party chief of PetroChina International Co.</P>
<P>Guo was sacked in June 2013, while Li and Shen were detained in August 2013 and in January, respectively.</P>
<P><STRONG>Network of Secretaries</STRONG></P>
<P>In 1988, 25-year-old Li Hualin was appointed to the general office of the newly established state oil major CNPC and worked as a secretary of the then deputy general manager of the company, Zhou Yongkang, who later joined the Politburo Standing Committee, the party's top decision-making body.</P>
<P>Zhou retired from the Politburo Standing Committee in late 2012. From 2007 to 2012, he headed the party's Central Politics and Law Committee, which meant he handled the nation's public security affairs.</P>
<P>In March 1992, Li was promoted to CNPC's Houston office in the United States as deputy head. Replacing him as the secretary was Shen Dingcheng, a classmate of Li's at the Southwest Petroleum Institute in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, which was later renamed Southwest Petroleum University.</P>
<P>Zhou left CNPC in 1998 after 31 years in the oil industry to head the new Ministry of Land and Resources (MLR). Shen remained at CNPC and was promoted to vice general manager of China National United Oil Corp., CNPC's oil trading subsidiary. Guo Yongxiang, Zhou's senior secretary at that time, followed Zhou to the MLR as general office director in July 1998.</P>
<P>In China, provincial and upper-level officials usually have two secretaries to support them in their work. A senior secretary helps the official with daily affairs while a secondary secretary helps arrange an agenda and prepare documents.</P>
<P>Replacing Shen as Zhou's secondary secretary was Ji Wenlin, who previously worked as deputy director of the general office of the then Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, which merged into the MLR. </P>
<P>Ji worked with Zhou for nearly a decade, following him to the Sichuan government in 2000 and the Ministry of Public Security in 2003. In 2008, Ji returned the MLR to become director of its general office – one year after Zhou was promoted to the Politburo Standing Committee.</P>
<P>Less information is available for Yu Gang and Tan Hong. Yu, a Jiangxi native, joined the general office of State Council, China's cabinet, as a secretary after graduation, and became Zhou's secondary secretary in 2003. Tan previously worked as Zhou's security secretary.</P>
<P><STRONG>Ties to CNPC</STRONG></P>
<P>Both Li Hualin and Shen Dingcheng spent most of their careers at CNPC. </P>
<P>"Probably because he started as a secretary, Li is more like an official rather than a company manager," a Hong Kong investor who knew Li said. "He is not an open-minded person."</P>
<P>But Li had a successful career at CNPC. After years in the company's Houston and Canada operations, he was appointed general manager of PetroChina International's Canadian branch in 1995. Four years later, he was named general manager of PetroChina International's branch in Kazakhstan. </P>
<P>Li returned to China in 2001 and became deputy general manager of PetroChina Hong Kong Co. In 2007, he was appointed vice president of PetroChina and chairman of subsidiary Kunlun Energy Co.</P>
<P>On July 29, 2013, CNPC published a statement naming Li vice general manager of the group. This was less than one month before he was placed under investigation by the CDIC.</P>
<P>Shen's fall came in January after nearly 17 years working at PetroChina International, the overseas oil and gas trading subsidiary of CNPC. Shen was the vice president and party chief of the company.</P>
<P><STRONG>The Fall of Guo Yongxiang</STRONG></P>
<P>Among the six, Guo Yongxiang and Ji Wenlin climbed highest. Sources said Guo has a strong relationship with the Sichuan government and the oil industry.</P>
<P>Born in 1949, Guo is a native of the eastern province of Shandong. He spent 26 years starting in 1972 at China's second-largest oil field, Shengli Oil Field, and in CNPC.</P>
<P>In July 1998, he was transferred to the general office of the new MLR as Zhou's senior secretary. Two years later, he moved to Sichuan to continue the secretary's job with Zhou, then party chief of the southwestern province.</P>
<P>Guo saw his career develop in Sichuan and he was appointed vice governor in January 2006. He oversaw agriculture, forestry and water projects.</P>
<P>Officials in Sichuan describe Guo as well-versed in how to succeed as an official in China.</P>
<P>"He was very experienced in officialdom," one official said. "He always had a smile on his face and was willing to do small favors."</P>
<P>Another source in the Sichuan government said Guo was trusted by higher leaders, and lower officials saw him as a bridge to those higher officials.</P>
<P>During his tenure, hydropower projects backed by Liu Han, chairman of Sichuan Hanlong Group; Wu Bing, chairman of Zhongxu (Hong Kong) Ltd.; and Zhou Bin, former chairman of Beijing Zhongxu Yangguang Petroleum and Natural Gas Technology Ltd., were approved. Both Wu and Zhou are embroiled in corruption inquiries, while Liu was formally arrested in July 2013 and stood on trial in late March for a host of gang-related crimes, including murder.</P>
<P>With his ties to CNPC, Guo also helped Sichuan-based private company Star Cable Co. Ltd. become a major supplier to CNPC and other state-owned hydropower and energy companies starting in 2004, local media reports say. According to Star Cable's documents, revenue from CNPC accounted for more than 30 percent of its revenue in the first half 2013. Last July, Li Guangyuan, chairman of Star Cable, was put under investigation.</P>
<P>Guo retired as vice governor in 2008, was elected vice chairman of the Sichuan People's Congress and appointed president of Sichuan Federation of Literary and Art Circles.</P>
<P>In June 2013, the CDIC announced it was probing Guo. In early April, the CDIC said on its website that Guo used his position to seek personal benefits and took massive bribes himself or through his son. Guo is also accused of amoral behavior, likely a reference to the keeping of mistresses. The anti-graft fighter said Guo was expelled from the party and facing criminal charges.</P>
<P><STRONG>Rise and Fall in Hainan</STRONG></P>
<P>After years as Zhou's secretary in the MLR, the Sichuan government and the security ministry, Ji saw his career take off in southern island province of Hainan. In 2010, the then 44-year-old Ji, who was working as director of the MLR's General Office, was appointed vice mayor and vice party secretary of Haikou, the capital city of Hainan, as part of the government's training program for young leaders. In January 2013, Ji was promoted to vice governor of Hainan.</P>
<P>Sources close to the Hainan government said Ji developed strong connections with officials during his days as secretary. In early 2011, he led several Haikou officials to Beijing to seek financial support for a development project in the city. Later that year, the MLR and the Ministry of Finance earmarked 3.2 billion yuan for the project, the fastest approval ever granted to the province.</P>
<P>Ji also led Haikou to apply for hosting the 2017 World Petroleum Congress. The application, filed with the State Council in January 2011, won approval by the cabinet in March 2012, despite this, the city lost the competition to Istanbul, Turkey. </P>
<P>A Haikou official said Ji "led a team to Beijing and met with officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, CNPC and the National Energy Administration and finally won approval by the State Council." Ji also met Jiang Jiemin, then chairman of CNPC, who promised to offer financial support to the city, said the Haikou official.</P>
<P>Jiang, who later became the head of China's state-owned asset regulator, was placed under a corruption investigation in September 2013. He was expelled from the party and his case was passed to prosecutors in July. </P>
<P>In January 2013, Ji was promoted to vice governor of Hainan, overseeing land and resources, urban planning and construction and state-owned assets.</P>
<P>Between late December and mid-January, Ji disappeared from the public eye for around 20 days, triggering speculation that he was being probed. A source close to the situation told Caixn that Ji was asked to go to Beijing for inquiries several times during that period. </P>
<P>But Ji resumed public activity in late January and attended the provincial people's congress in early February.</P>
<P>However, on February 18, the CDIC published a statement on its website that said Ji was under investigation for "serious discipline violations," making him the 19th vice minister-level official to be sacked since the 18th party congress in November 2012. Ji is also the last of six secretaries related to Zhou to be detained. </P>
<P>On July 2, the CDIC announced that Ji had been expelled from the party for abusing his power, taking a huge amount of bribes and adultery. Ji faces criminal charges.　　</P>
<P>The same day, the commission said in separate statements that Yu Gang was expelled for similar charges. Tan Hong was also expelled for power abuse and taking bribes.</P>
